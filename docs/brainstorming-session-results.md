   _Post-Quiz Interventions:_

   - Immediate review of missed questions with AI tutor
   - Conversational explanations to strengthen understanding
   - "Let's talk through why this tripped you up" prompts

   _Knowledge Gap Targeting:_

   - Mix struggling topics into future sessions

   - User-set threshold for distractions per hour
   - Alert after threshold reached: "You've been distracted X times this hour"
   - Suggest focus techniques or break if pattern continues

   _Pacing Control:_

   - Detect too-quick incorrect answers â†’ slow student down
   - "Take your time" prompts when rushing detected
   - Temporarily lock "Next" button for 3-5 seconds on rushed wrong answers

   _Gamification Interventions:_

   - "You're on fire!" streak notifications for consecutive correct answers
