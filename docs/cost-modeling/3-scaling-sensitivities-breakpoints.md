## 1. Infrastructure Scaling Analysis

### 1.1 Hosting & Compute Scaling Curve

```
User Count → Monthly Cost (Cumulative)
100 users  → $45   (Current baseline)
250 users  → $85   (+$40 step increase)
500 users  → $125  (+$40 gradual)
750 users  → $155  (+$30 gradual)
1000 users → $180  (+$25 step increase)
```

**Winston's Technical Assessment**:

**Breakpoint Analysis**:
- **250 users**: Vercel hobby tier exhausted, requires Pro tier
- **500 users**: Railway shared compute insufficient, dedicated instances needed
- **750 users**: CDN becomes cost-effective for static assets
- **1000 users**: Load balancer required for connection distribution

**Scaling Characteristics**:
- **Linear components** (30%): Basic hosting, storage
- **Step-function components** (70%): Compute tiers, service upgrades

### 1.2 Database Scaling Profile

```
Database Connections vs Performance:
100 users  → 25 connections  → $25/month (Supabase Starter)
250 users  → 60 connections  → $25/month (still within limits)
500 users  → 120 connections → $65/month (Pro tier required)
750 users  → 180 connections → $85/month (connection pooling stress)
1000 users → 240 connections → $125/month (performance optimization needed)
```

**Critical Breakpoint at 750 users**:
- Connection pool saturation causes performance degradation
- Requires database optimization and connection management
- Query response times increase from 50ms to 200ms without intervention

### 1.3 External Service Scaling Sensitivities

**AI Service Usage Patterns**:
```
Daily Question Generation:
100 users  → 150 questions/day  → $25/month
250 users  → 400 questions/day  → $65/month
500 users  → 850 questions/day  → $140/month
750 users  → 1,300 questions/day → $215/month
1000 users → 1,800 questions/day → $320/month
```

**Sensitivity Factors**:
- **Power user concentration**: 20% of users generate 60% of AI costs
- **Seasonal variations**: +40% during LSAT test months
- **Feature adoption**: New AI features can spike costs by 25%

## 2. Human Resources Scaling Breakpoints

### 2.1 Customer Support Scaling Thresholds

```
Support Staffing Requirements:
0-200 users   → 0.5 FTE ($1,250/month)
200-500 users → 1.0 FTE ($2,500/month)
500-800 users → 1.5 FTE ($3,750/month)
800+ users    → 2.0 FTE ($5,000/month)
```

**Breakpoint Analysis**:
- **200 users**: Part-time to full-time transition
- **500 users**: Additional support person needed
- **800 users**: Support lead role required

**Ticket Volume Projections**:
- Current: 1.2 tickets/user/month
- Optimized (with self-service): 0.8 tickets/user/month
- Worst case (complex platform): 2.0 tickets/user/month

### 2.2 Technical Operations Scaling

```
DevOps Resource Allocation:
0-300 users   → 25% allocation ($750/month)
300-600 users → 40% allocation ($1,200/month)
600-1000 users → 60% allocation ($1,800/month)
1000+ users   → 100% dedicated ($3,000/month)
```

## 3. Cost Sensitivity Analysis

### 3.1 Variable Cost Sensitivities (±20% user volume)

| Cost Category | Base Cost (1000u) | -20% (800u) | +20% (1200u) | Elasticity |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| AI Services | $320 | $245 (-23%) | $410 (+28%) | 1.3 |
| Support | $375 | $300 (-20%) | $450 (+20%) | 1.0 |
| Infrastructure | $180 | $155 (-14%) | $215 (+19%) | 0.8 |
| Content | $180 | $145 (-19%) | $220 (+22%) | 1.1 |

**Insights**:
- **AI services** most elastic - higher user engagement drives disproportionate costs
- **Infrastructure** least elastic - economies of scale benefits
- **Support** linear scaling - most predictable category

### 3.2 External Shock Scenarios

**High AI Usage Scenario** (+50% above baseline):
- New feature drives 50% more AI interactions
- Cost increase: +$160/month
- Mitigation: Usage caps, throttling

**Support Surge Scenario** (+100% ticket volume):
- Platform complexity or onboarding issues
- Cost increase: +$375/month
- Mitigation: Better documentation, automation

**Infrastructure Spike Scenario** (+30% peak load):
- Viral growth or exam season surge
- Cost increase: +$54/month
- Mitigation: Auto-scaling policies
