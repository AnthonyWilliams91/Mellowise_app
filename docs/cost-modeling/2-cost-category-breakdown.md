## 1. Infrastructure & Technical Costs

### 1.1 Hosting & Compute Infrastructure
**Monthly Cost: $180**

| Component | Current (100 users) | Scaled (1000 users) | Cost Driver |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Vercel Pro | $20 | $65 | Bandwidth, compute |
| Railway Pro | $20 | $75 | CPU hours, memory |
| Load Balancing | $0 | $25 | Traffic routing |
| Auto-scaling Buffer | $5 | $15 | Peak capacity |

**Winston's Analysis**: Current $40/month scales non-linearly due to:
- Bandwidth costs (Vercel): 100GB ‚Üí 800GB = 3.25x multiplier
- Compute hours (Railway): Sustained load requires dedicated instances
- New requirement: Load balancing for 1000 concurrent users

### 1.2 Database & Storage Costs
**Monthly Cost: $125**

| Component | Current | Scaled | Scaling Factor |
|-----------|---------|--------|----------------|
| Supabase Pro | $25 | $85 | Database size, connections |
| Data Transfer | $0 | $15 | API calls, file uploads |
| Backup & Archive | $5 | $25 | Data retention policies |

**Key Insight**: Database costs scale superlinearly due to connection pooling limits and storage growth from user-generated content.

### 1.3 External Service & API Costs
**Monthly Cost: $420**

| Service | Current | Scaled | Usage Model |
|---------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **AI Services** | | | |
| - Anthropic Claude | $25 | $220 | Per-token usage |
| - OpenAI Backup | $15 | $100 | Fallback capacity |
| **Communication** | | | |
| - Twilio SMS | $10 | $35 | User notifications |
| - Email (Resend) | $0 | $15 | Transactional emails |
| **Analytics & Monitoring** | | | |
| - Sentry | $26 | $45 | Error volume |
| - Analytics Tools | $0 | $5 | User tracking |

**Critical Cost Driver**: AI services represent 76% of external costs due to question generation and personalized feedback.

**Support Calculation**: 1000 users √ó 1.2 tickets/month √ó 6 minutes = 120 hours

### 2.2 Content & Licensing Costs
**Monthly Cost: $180**

| Category | Cost | Rationale |
|----------|------|-----------|
| LSAT Question Licensing | $120 | $0.12 per question √ó 1000 questions |
| Content Updates | $35 | Monthly question pool refresh |
| Quality Assurance | $25 | Content validation process |

### 2.3 Compliance & Legal
**Monthly Cost: $67**

| Component | Monthly Cost |
