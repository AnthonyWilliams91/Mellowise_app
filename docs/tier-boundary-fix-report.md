# Tier Boundary Logic Fix - Implementation Report

**Date**: October 5, 2025
**Developer**: James (Dev Agent)
**Issue**: Tier boundary display showing incorrect "current tier" when a tier has 0 spots remaining

---

## Problem Statement

When a user's position exactly filled a tier (position 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500), the UI incorrectly displayed:
```
> Tier 1: 0/100 spots at $15/month <YOU ARE HERE>
```

This was **incorrect** because:
- Tier 1 is FULL (0 spots remaining)
- The NEXT signup would receive Tier 2 pricing
- Therefore, Tier 2 should be highlighted as the current tier, not Tier 1

---

## Root Cause Analysis

The original logic in `/app/landing/page.tsx` used `currentTier` directly from the API response to determine which tier to highlight:

```typescript
// BEFORE (INCORRECT)
const currentTier = tierData.tier;
const isPastTier = tierInfo.tier < currentTier;
const isCurrentTier = tierInfo.tier === currentTier;
const isFutureTier = tierInfo.tier > currentTier;
```

When `tierData.spotsRemaining === 0`, the tier was full but still being marked as "current", which created a logical inconsistency.

---

## Solution Implemented

### Code Changes

**File Modified**: `/app/landing/page.tsx`

**Change 1**: Added `displayTier` calculation logic (lines 49-54)
```typescript
// Calculate the "display tier" - the tier that should be highlighted as current
// If current tier is full (0 spots remaining), the next tier is the display tier
// Cap at tier 6 since that's the max tier
const displayTier = spotsRemaining === 0
  ? Math.min(currentTier + 1, 6)
  : currentTier;
```

**Change 2**: Updated tier comparison logic (lines 68-70)
```typescript
// Use displayTier instead of currentTier for rendering decisions
const isPastTier = tierInfo.tier < displayTier;
const isCurrentTier = tierInfo.tier === displayTier;
const isFutureTier = tierInfo.tier > displayTier;
```

**Change 3**: Fixed spots display for boundary cases (lines 83-88)
```typescript
// Calculate spots to display based on whether we're at a boundary
// If we're showing the next tier (displayTier > currentTier), show full capacity
// Otherwise, show actual remaining for current tier
const actualSpotsRemaining = displayTier > currentTier
  ? tierInfo.capacity // Show full capacity for the next tier
  : spotsRemaining; // Show actual remaining for current tier
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Position 100 (Tier 1 Full)
```
  ~~Tier 1: 0/100 available at $15/month~~           (struck through - FULL)
> Tier 2: 100/100 spots at $20/month  <YOU ARE HERE> (next available tier)
  Tier 3: 100/100 available at $25/month
  Tier 4: 100/100 available at $30/month
  Tier 5: 100/100 available at $35/month
  Tier 6: ∞ available at $49/month (for a limited time only)
```

### Position 200 (Tier 2 Full)
```
  ~~Tier 1: 0/100 available at $15/month~~           (struck through)
  ~~Tier 2: 0/100 available at $20/month~~           (struck through - FULL)
> Tier 3: 100/100 spots at $25/month  <YOU ARE HERE> (next available tier)
  Tier 4: 100/100 available at $30/month
  Tier 5: 100/100 available at $35/month
  Tier 6: ∞ available at $49/month (for a limited time only)
```

### Position 500 (Tier 5 Full)
```
  ~~Tier 1: 0/100 available at $15/month~~           (struck through)
  ~~Tier 2: 0/100 available at $20/month~~           (struck through)
  ~~Tier 3: 0/100 available at $25/month~~           (struck through)
  ~~Tier 4: 0/100 available at $30/month~~           (struck through)
  ~~Tier 5: 0/100 available at $35/month~~           (struck through - FULL)
> Tier 6: ∞ available at $49/month (for a limited time only) <YOU ARE HERE>
```

**Boundary Cases Summary**:
- Position 100: Tier 1 FULL (0 spots) → Display Tier 2 ✅
- Position 200: Tier 2 FULL (0 spots) → Display Tier 3 ✅
- Position 300: Tier 3 FULL (0 spots) → Display Tier 4 ✅
- Position 400: Tier 4 FULL (0 spots) → Display Tier 5 ✅

### Build Verification

**Command**: `npm run build`
**Result**: ✅ **SUCCESS**
- No TypeScript errors
- No build warnings related to the changes
- All routes compiled successfully

### Visual Verification (Browser Testing)

**Test Environment**: Next.js dev server (http://localhost:3000/landing)
**Database State**: Position 200 (Tier 2 full, 0 spots remaining)

**API Response**:
```json
{
  "tier": 2,
  "price": 20,
  "spotsRemaining": 0,
  "totalSignups": 200,
  "mockData": false
}
```

**UI Display**: ✅ **CORRECT**
- Tier 1: Struck through, showing 0/100
- Tier 2: Struck through, showing 0/100 (FULL)
- **Tier 3: Highlighted with green border, showing "100/100 spots at $25/month" with <YOU ARE HERE> badge**
- Tier 4-6: Displayed as future tiers

## Edge Cases Handled

### 1. Tier 6 Boundary Protection
```typescript
const displayTier = spotsRemaining === 0
  ? Math.min(currentTier + 1, 6)  // ← Cap at tier 6
  : currentTier;
```
- When Tier 5 is full (position 500), displayTier = 6
- Tier 6 has unlimited capacity (∞), so it never triggers the boundary condition
- No risk of displayTier exceeding 6

### 2. Non-Boundary Positions
- Positions 1-99, 101-199, 201-299, etc. continue to work correctly
- Display tier matches data tier when spots remain
- No regression in existing functionality

### 3. Loading State
```typescript
const displaySpots = tierInfo.capacity === null
  ? '∞'
  : `${loading ? '...' : actualSpotsRemaining}/${tierInfo.capacity}`;
```
- Loading indicator ("...") still displays during data fetch
- Proper display after data loads
