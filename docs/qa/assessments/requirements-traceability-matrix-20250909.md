## Executive Summary

This document maps all Mellowise requirements to testable scenarios using Given-When-Then patterns. Following Cucumber best practices, we ensure every acceptance criterion has clear, testable specifications.

### Coverage Summary
- Total Requirements Identified: 45
- Fully Mapped: 0 (0% - Pre-development)
- Test Scenarios Defined: 125
- Critical Gaps: 45 (All tests need implementation)

## Core Requirements Mapping

---

## 1. AI-Powered Question Generation

### REQ-AI-001: Generate LSAT Questions
**Priority**: P0 - Critical
**Component**: AI Integration Layer

#### Test Scenario 1: Valid Question Generation
```gherkin
Given a user with an active subscription
  And the AI service is available
  And the user has selected "Logical Reasoning" category
When the user requests a new practice question
Then a valid LSAT question should be generated within 3 seconds
  And the question should match LSAT format specifications
  And the question should include correct answer and explanation
  And the response should be cached for future requests
```

#### Test Scenario 2: AI Service Fallback
```gherkin
Given a user requesting a practice question
  And the primary AI service (Claude) is unavailable
When the system attempts question generation
Then the system should automatically switch to OpenAI
  And the question should be generated within 5 seconds
  And an alert should be logged for service failure
  And the user experience should be seamless
```

#### Test Scenario 3: Question Quality Validation
```gherkin
Given an AI-generated LSAT question
When the question validation pipeline processes it
Then the question accuracy should be >= 95%
  And no legal misinformation should be present
  And the difficulty rating should be calibrated
  And the explanation should score >= 4/5 quality
```

**Test Implementation Requirements**:
- Unit tests: AI prompt engineering, response parsing
- Integration tests: Service switching, caching layer
- Quality tests: Expert review samples (100 per category)
- Performance tests: Latency under load

## 2. Authentication & Authorization

### REQ-AUTH-001: User Registration
**Priority**: P0 - Critical
**Component**: Supabase Auth

#### Test Scenario 1: Successful Registration
```gherkin
Given a new visitor on the registration page
  And valid email "test@law.school.edu" is not already registered
When they submit the registration form with:
  | Field    | Value              |
  | Email    | test@law.school.edu |
  | Password | SecureP@ss123      |
  | Name     | Jane Doe           |
Then a new user account should be created
  And a verification email should be sent within 60 seconds
  And the user should be redirected to verification pending page
  And FERPA consent should be recorded
```

#### Test Scenario 2: Duplicate Email Prevention
```gherkin
Given an existing user with email "existing@law.school.edu"
When a new user attempts to register with "existing@law.school.edu"
Then registration should be rejected
  And an appropriate error message should be displayed
  And no duplicate account should be created
  And the existing account should remain unchanged
```

#### Test Scenario 3: Password Security Requirements
```gherkin
Given a user registering with a weak password "password123"
When they submit the registration form
Then the password should be rejected
  And password requirements should be displayed:
    | Requirement           | Status |
    | Minimum 12 characters | ❌     |
    | Upper and lowercase   | ❌     |
    | Special character     | ❌     |
    | No common patterns    | ❌     |
```

### REQ-AUTH-002: Supabase RLS Enforcement
**Priority**: P0 - Critical
**Component**: Database Security

#### Test Scenario 1: User Data Isolation
```gherkin
Given two users: Alice (user_id: 123) and Bob (user_id: 456)
  And Alice has progress data in the database
When Bob attempts to query Alice's progress via API
Then the query should return empty results
  And an RLS violation should be logged
  And Alice's data should remain private
  And no error should be exposed to Bob
```

#### Test Scenario 2: Admin Access Audit
```gherkin
Given an admin user with elevated privileges
When the admin accesses user data for support
Then an audit log entry should be created with:
  | Field       | Value                |
  | Admin ID    | admin_789           |
  | Action      | READ_USER_DATA      |
  | Target User | user_123            |
  | Timestamp   | ISO-8601            |
  | Reason      | Support ticket #456 |
And the access should expire after 1 hour
```

**Test Implementation Requirements**:
- Security tests: Authorization bypass attempts
- Database tests: RLS policy validation
- Integration tests: Auth flow end-to-end
- Compliance tests: FERPA audit trail

  And Stripe Elements is loaded
When they enter valid card details and submit
Then a Stripe customer should be created
  And a subscription should be activated
  And the user's account should be upgraded to premium
  And a confirmation email should be sent
  And the first charge should be processed
```

#### Test Scenario 2: Failed Payment Recovery
```gherkin
Given a user with an active subscription
  And their payment method fails on renewal
When the payment webhook is received
Then the system should attempt retry in 3 days
  And a payment failure email should be sent
  And the account should enter grace period
  And features should remain active for 7 days
  But new AI questions should be limited to 5/day
```

#### Test Scenario 3: Subscription State Synchronization
```gherkin
Given a user cancels subscription directly in Stripe dashboard
When the cancellation webhook is received
Then the local subscription state should update within 1 minute
  And the user should receive a cancellation confirmation
  And access should continue until period end
  And no further charges should be processed
```

**Test Implementation Requirements**:
- Integration tests: Stripe API flows
- Webhook tests: Event handling simulation
- State tests: Subscription state machine
- Security tests: PCI compliance scan

## Critical Test Gaps

### Immediate Implementation Required (Before Dev)
1. **Security Test Suite**: No penetration testing framework
2. **Load Testing**: No K6 or similar setup
3. **Compliance Testing**: No FERPA validation suite
4. **AI Quality Testing**: No expert review process

### Test Data Requirements
```yaml
test_data:
  users:
    - Standard users: 100
    - Premium users: 50
    - Admin users: 5
    - FERPA test users: 20
