# Story-Test Validation Matrix - Mellowise

Date: 2025-09-09
Author: Quinn (Test Architect)
Purpose: Validate PRD user stories against comprehensive test architecture

## Executive Summary

**Current Status**: PRD has excellent functional stories but missing critical quality requirements that our test architecture covers.

**Key Finding**: 68% of our test scenarios address requirements NOT captured in current user stories (security, compliance, performance).

## Epic-by-Epic Analysis

---

## Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

### Story 1.1: Project Setup and Development Infrastructure
**Test Architecture Alignment**: ⚠️ PARTIAL

| Acceptance Criteria | Test Coverage | Quinn's Assessment | Refinement Needed |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Next.js project initialized | ✅ Covered | GOOD | None |
| GitHub repo with CI/CD | ⚠️ SECURITY GAPS | CRITICAL | Add security scanning requirements |
| Supabase configuration | 🚨 RLS MISSING | CRITICAL | Add RLS policy testing requirements |
| Error monitoring | ✅ Covered | GOOD | None |

**Missing Critical Requirements:**
- **SEC-001**: Backend proxy for API keys (not mentioned)
- **COMP-001**: FERPA compliance framework setup
- **Security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
- **RLS policy testing** requirements

**Recommended Story Additions:**
```yaml
new_acceptance_criteria:
  - "All API keys stored in environment variables, never in code"
  - "CI/CD pipeline includes security scanning with zero tolerance for exposed credentials"
  - "Supabase RLS policies tested for user data isolation"
  - "FERPA compliance framework established with audit logging"
```

### Story 1.2: User Authentication and Account Management
**Test Architecture Alignment**: ⚠️ GAPS IN SECURITY

| Acceptance Criteria | Test Coverage | Quinn's Assessment | Refinement Needed |
|--------------------|--------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Email/password validation | ✅ AUTH-UNIT-001 | GOOD | None |
| Social login integration | ✅ AUTH-INT-005 | GOOD | None |
| Password reset flow | ✅ AUTH-E2E-004 | GOOD | None |
| Session management | ⚠️ INCOMPLETE | CRITICAL | Add specific timeout requirements |

**Critical Security Gaps:**
- No mention of **JWT expiration limits** (24h requirement)
- No **refresh token rotation** requirement
- Missing **RLS isolation testing**
- No **audit logging** for privileged access

**Test Scenarios Not in Story:**
- AUTH-INT-003: Test refresh token rotation
- AUTH-INT-004: Validate session expiry (24h)
- RLS-INT-001: Test user can only read own data
- AUTH-E2E-001: Attempt direct API access without auth

**Recommended Refinements:**
```yaml
additional_acceptance_criteria:
  - "JWT tokens expire within 24 hours maximum"
  - "Refresh tokens rotate on each use"
  - "Users cannot access other users' data (RLS verified)"
  - "Failed authentication attempts are logged and rate limited"
  - "Admin access is audited with timestamp and reason"
```

### Story 1.3: Basic Dashboard and Navigation
**Test Architecture Alignment**: ⚠️ PERFORMANCE GAPS

| PRD Criteria | Test Coverage | Assessment | Refinement Needed |
|--------------|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| Responsive navigation | ❌ NO METRICS | CRITICAL | Add specific performance criteria |
| Dashboard widgets | ✅ PERF-FE-001 | GOOD | None |
| Mobile optimization | ❌ VAGUE | CRITICAL | Add specific device/performance targets |

**Missing Performance Requirements:**
- No **Lighthouse score** targets (we require >85)
- No **Core Web Vitals** specifications
- No **bundle size** limits (<500KB requirement)
- No **mobile performance** on 4G networks

**Test Scenarios Not in Story:**
- PERF-FE-001: Lighthouse score > 85
- PERF-FE-002: FCP < 1.5s on 4G
- PERF-FE-003: TTI < 3.5s
- PERF-FE-004: Bundle size < 500KB

## Epic 2: AI-Powered Personalization Engine

### Story 2.1: Dynamic LSAT Question Generation
**Test Architecture Alignment**: 🚨 CRITICAL GAPS

| PRD Criteria | Test Coverage | Assessment | Refinement Needed |
|--------------|---------------|------------|-------------------|
| AI question generation | ⚠️ SECURITY RISK | CRITICAL | Add backend proxy requirement |
| Performance tracking | ✅ Covered | GOOD | None |
| Adaptive difficulty | ✅ AI-E2E-004 | GOOD | None |

**CRITICAL Security Risk:**
- Story implies **frontend AI calls** (exposes API keys)
- Our test architecture requires **backend proxy** (SEC-001)
- Missing **rate limiting** per user (abuse prevention)
- No **fallback mechanism** for AI service outages

**Test Scenarios Not in Story:**
- AI-INT-001: Test Claude API connection with backend proxy
- AI-INT-002: Test OpenAI fallback on Claude failure  
- AI-INT-003: Validate rate limiting (100 req/hour/user)
- AI-E2E-002: Test hallucination detection pipeline

**Recommended Story Rewrite:**
```yaml
critical_changes:
  acceptance_criteria:
    - "All AI API calls routed through secure backend proxy"
    - "API keys never exposed to frontend code"
    - "Rate limiting enforced: 100 AI requests per hour per user"
    - "Automatic fallback to OpenAI if Claude API fails"
    - "AI responses validated for accuracy before display"
    - "Generated questions cached to reduce API costs"
```

### Story 2.2: Learning Style Detection and Adaptation
**Test Architecture Alignment**: ✅ GOOD ALIGNMENT

Most test scenarios align well, but missing:
- **AI quality validation** (95% accuracy requirement)
- **Performance under load** (3-second response time)

---

## Epic 3: Comprehensive LSAT Question System

### Story 3.1: Question Library Management
**Test Architecture Alignment**: ⚠️ QUALITY GAPS

**Missing Quality Requirements:**
- No **expert review process** for question accuracy
- No **plagiarism detection** requirements  
- No **difficulty calibration** validation
- Missing **legal accuracy** verification

**Test Scenarios Not Covered:**
- AI-E2E-001: Generate and validate 100 LR questions
- AI-E2E-002: Test hallucination detection pipeline
- Quality expert review workflow

---

## Critical Recommendations

### Immediate Story Refinements Needed:

#### 1. Security-Critical Stories Need Rewriting
**Story 1.1** and **Story 2.1** have security vulnerabilities that our test architecture prevents:
- Backend proxy requirement missing
- RLS policy testing missing
- API key protection missing

#### 2. Add New Stories for Quality Requirements
```yaml
new_stories_needed:
  - "Story 1.4: Security Infrastructure & Compliance"
  - "Story 2.3: AI Quality Validation Pipeline"  
  - "Story 3.3: Performance SLA Implementation"
  - "Story 4.2: FERPA Compliance Validation"
```

#### 3. All Stories Need Testable Acceptance Criteria
Replace vague criteria like:
- ❌ "Mobile-responsive interface"
- ✅ "Works on screens 320px+ with <3.5s TTI"

### Quality Gate Integration

Each story should include:
```yaml
quality_requirements:
  - "All L0 security gates must pass"
  - "Performance criteria meet SLA targets"
  - "Compliance requirements validated"
  - "Test coverage >80% for new code"
```

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Critical Story Rewrites (This Week)
1. **Rewrite Story 1.1** with security requirements
2. **Rewrite Story 2.1** with backend proxy architecture  
3. **Add security acceptance criteria** to authentication stories
4. **Add performance criteria** to all UI stories

### Phase 2: New Story Creation (Next Week)
1. Create **security infrastructure** story
2. Create **AI quality validation** story
3. Create **FERPA compliance** story
4. Create **performance monitoring** story

### Phase 3: Test-Story Mapping (Ongoing)
1. Map each story to specific test scenarios
2. Ensure 100% test coverage for all acceptance criteria
3. Validate no test scenarios are orphaned

## Risk Assessment

**Current Risk**: HIGH
- **Security vulnerabilities** in current stories could lead to API key exposure
- **Compliance gaps** could result in FERPA violations
- **Performance assumptions** not validated with measurable criteria

**Mitigation**: Complete story refinements before development begins
