  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Implement backend proxy for all AI API calls'
      - 'Create comprehensive RLS testing suite'
      - 'Establish FERPA compliance framework'
      - 'Build AI question validation pipeline'
      - 'Set up performance monitoring with SLAs'
    monitor:
      - 'AI response times and fallback rates'
      - 'Security alerts for auth endpoints'
      - 'Database query performance'
      - 'WebSocket connection stability'
      - 'Payment processing success rates'
