### 1.6 FAQ Section

**Headline:**
```
Frequently Asked Questions
```

#### Q1: When does beta launch?
```
We're launching beta access in 2-4 weeks. Waitlist members get first access
based on their signup position. You'll receive an email notification when your
spot is ready.
```

#### Q2: How does the pricing work?
```
Your pricing is locked in based on when you join the waitlist. Early supporters
get the best rates - from $15/month for the first 100 signups to $35/month for
positions 401-500. After 500, everyone gets 50% off our regular $99/month price
($49/month locked in forever). Once you claim your spot, your price never changes.
```

#### Q3: Can I improve my pricing after signing up?
```
Yes! You can move up one tier from where you started by referring friends or
sharing on social media:

• Refer 3 friends = Jump 10 spots
• Share on social media = Jump 5 spots per platform (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,
  TikTok, LinkedIn - once per platform)

Example: If you're in Tier 2 (#127), you can refer friends and share on social
platforms to unlock Tier 1 pricing ($15/month). Once you reach the next tier up,
additional referrals are appreciated but won't improve your pricing further.

Your position in the activation queue stays the same - only your pricing improves.
```

#### Q4: What makes Mellowise different from Kaplan or Princeton Review?
```
Traditional LSAT prep costs $1,500+ and uses the same teaching methods from the
1990s. Mellowise uses AI to personalize every question to your learning style,
combines it with gamified Survival Mode to make studying actually enjoyable, and
costs 90% less. Plus, you can study anytime, anywhere - no rigid class schedules.
```

#### Q5: Is this real LSAT content or practice questions?
```
We use authentic LSAT question formats and logic patterns. Our AI generates
unlimited practice questions that mirror real test conditions, so you're always
prepared for what you'll see on test day.
```

#### Q6: What devices can I use Mellowise on?
```
Mellowise works on desktop, tablet, and mobile. We recommend desktop for the
best Survival Mode experience, but you can review flashcards and track progress
on any device.
```

#### Q7: Is there a free trial?
```
Beta members get 30 days free to explore the full platform. If you're not
seeing score improvements, cancel anytime - no questions asked.
```

#### Q8: What happens if I don't activate when beta launches?
```
Your locked-in pricing is guaranteed for 30 days after you receive your beta
access email. If you don't activate within 30 days, your spot goes to the next
person on the waitlist.

### 4.2 Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Tier 2 User (#127) → Reaches Tier 1

**Initial State:**
- Position: #127 (Tier 2: positions 101-200)
- Initial Pricing: $20/month
- Goal: Tier 1 ($15/month)
- Spots Needed: 27+ (to reach #100 or better)

**Path A: Heavy Referrals**
1. Refer 3 friends (batch 1) = 10 spots → Now at #117
2. Refer 3 friends (batch 2) = 10 spots → Now at #107
3. Refer 3 friends (batch 3) = 10 spots → Now at #97 ✅
**Result:** Tier 1 unlocked! Final pricing: $15/month

**Path B: Balanced Approach**
1. Refer 3 friends (batch 1) = 10 spots → Now at #117
2. Share on Twitter = 5 spots → Now at #112
3. Share on Facebook = 5 spots → Now at #107
4. Refer 3 friends (batch 2) = 10 spots → Now at #97 ✅
**Result:** Tier 1 unlocked! Final pricing: $15/month (6 referrals + 2 shares)

**Path C: Social Media Heavy**
1. Share on all 5 platforms = 25 spots → Now at #102
2. Refer 3 friends = 10 spots → Now at #92 ✅
**Result:** Tier 1 unlocked! Final pricing: $15/month (3 referrals + 5 shares)

**After Reaching Tier 1:**
- Any additional referrals/shares are appreciated but do not improve pricing further
- User is locked at $15/month (cannot go lower)

---

#### Scenario 2: Tier 5 User (#450) → Reaches Tier 4

**Initial State:**
- Position: #450 (Tier 5: positions 401-500)
- Initial Pricing: $35/month
- Goal: Tier 4 ($30/month)
- Spots Needed: 50+ (to reach #400 or better)

**Path A: Maximum Effort**

**Result:** Tier 4 unlocked! Final pricing: $30/month

**Path B: Combined Approach**
1. Share on all 5 platforms = 25 spots → Now at #425
2. Refer 9 friends (3 batches × 3) = 30 spots → Now at #395 ✅
**Result:** Tier 4 unlocked! Final pricing: $30/month (9 referrals + 5 shares)

**Cannot Jump to Tier 3:**
- User started in Tier 5, can only reach Tier 4 (1 tier improvement)
- Even if they refer 30 friends (100 spots) and reach position #350, they stay at $30/month
- Tier 3 pricing ($25/month) is not available to this user

- Referrer gets notification when 3rd friend confirms: "Congratulations! You've jumped 10 spots"

### 4.4 Anti-Abuse Measures

**Prevent Gaming:**
- ✅ Email verification required for all signups (no unverified emails count toward referral)
- ✅ IP address tracking (prevent same person signing up multiple times)
- ✅ Disposable email blocklist (reject temp email services like Mailinator, 10minutemail)
- ✅ Manual review for suspicious referral patterns (10+ referrals from same IP or device)
- ✅ Tier cap: Maximum 1 tier improvement from initial signup tier (prevent multi-tier exploitation)
- ✅ Social share verification: Require actual click-throughs (not just button click)
- ✅ Rate limiting: Maximum 3 referrals processed per day (prevent bulk fake signups)

**Database Flag for Suspicious Activity:**
```json
{
  "user_id": "uuid",
  "flagged": true,
  "flag_reason": "10+ referrals from same IP address",
  "requires_manual_review": true,
  "referrals_on_hold": 7
}
```

## 5. Conversion Optimization Strategy

### 5.1 A/B Testing Roadmap (Post-Launch)

**Test 1: Headline Variation**
- Control: "Welcome to Mellowise"
- Variant A: "Stop Overpaying for LSAT Prep"
- Variant B: "Master the LSAT with AI That Knows You"
- **Metric:** Signup conversion rate

**Test 2: Pricing Widget Placement**
- Control: Above signup form
- Variant: Below headline, before form
- **Metric:** Signup conversion rate

**Test 3: CTA Copy**
- Control: "Lock In $15/month with Email"
- Variant: "Claim Your Spot at $15/month"
- **Metric:** Click-through rate on CTA

**Test 4: Referral Incentive Display**
- Control: Show on success page only
- Variant: Tease referral program on landing page ("Sign up to unlock referral rewards")
- **Metric:** Referral participation rate

**Test 5: Social Proof**
- Control: No counter (clean launch)
- Variant: Show "Join X students" once 250+ signups
- **Metric:** Signup conversion rate

---

### 5.2 Analytics & Tracking

**Key Metrics to Track:**

**Landing Page:**
- Page views
- Bounce rate (target: < 40%)
- Time on page (target: 60+ seconds)
- Scroll depth (% who see pricing widget - target: 70%+)
- CTA click rate (Google OAuth vs Email - target: 40%+ combined)
- Signup conversion rate by tier (target: 25%+ overall)

**Success Page:**
- Referral link click rate (target: 50%+)
- Social share rate by platform (target: 10%+ per platform)
- Time on page (engagement with referral program - target: 90+ seconds)

**Email Sequence:**
- Open rate (target: 40%+)
- Click-through rate (target: 15%+)
- Referral participation rate (target: 15%+)
- Beta activation rate (target: 60%+)

**Referral Program:**
- % of users who refer at least 1 friend (target: 15%+)
- Average referrals per user (target: 2+)
- % of users who share on at least 1 platform (target: 20%+)
- Viral coefficient / K-factor (target: 1.2+)
- % of users who successfully jump 1 tier (target: 10%+)

**Funnel Conversion:**
```
Stage 1: Land on Page (100%)
↓ (Target: 70% scroll to pricing)
Stage 2: View Pricing Widget (70%)
↓ (Target: 40% click CTA)
Stage 3: Click CTA (28%)
↓ (Target: 80% complete signup)
Stage 4: Complete Signup (22.4%)
↓ (Target: 15% refer friends)
Stage 5: Refer Friends (3.4%)
↓ (Target: 60% activate on beta launch)
Stage 6: Activate Beta Access (13.4%)
```

**Overall Goal:** 25%+ visitor-to-signup conversion rate

---

### 5.3 Viral Growth Projections

**Assumptions:**
- 15% of users refer at least 1 friend
- Average 2.5 referrals per active referrer
- 80% of referred friends sign up (high conversion due to personal recommendation)

**K-Factor Calculation:**
```
K = (% who refer) × (avg referrals) × (referral conversion rate)
K = 0.15 × 2.5 × 0.80 = 0.30

Current K-factor: 0.30 (each user brings 0.30 new users)
```

**To Reach K > 1.0 (Viral Growth):**
- Need 25% participation OR 5 referrals per user OR 90% referral conversion
- **Strategy:** Increase referral participation to 25% through email nudges and success page optimization

**Growth Projection (K = 1.2):**
```
Week 1: 100 organic signups → 120 total (20 via referrals)
Week 2: 120 organic → 144 total
Week 3: 144 organic → 173 total
Week 4: 173 organic → 208 total
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Month 1 Total: ~650 waitlist members (150 organic + referral multiplier)
```

## 6. Technical Requirements for Dev Team

### 6.1 Dynamic Content System

**Pricing Tier Logic:**
```javascript
const getTierInfo = (position) => {
  if (position <= 100) return { tier: 1, price: 15, tierName: 'Tier 1' };
  if (position <= 200) return { tier: 2, price: 20, tierName: 'Tier 2' };
  if (position <= 300) return { tier: 3, price: 25, tierName: 'Tier 3' };
  if (position <= 400) return { tier: 4, price: 30, tierName: 'Tier 4' };
  if (position <= 500) return { tier: 5, price: 35, tierName: 'Tier 5' };
  return { tier: 6, price: 49, tierName: '501+' };
};

const getCurrentAvailableTier = (totalSignups) => {
  if (totalSignups < 100) return { tier: 1, price: 15, remaining: 100 - totalSignups };
  if (totalSignups < 200) return { tier: 2, price: 20, remaining: 200 - totalSignups };
  if (totalSignups < 300) return { tier: 3, price: 25, remaining: 300 - totalSignups };
  if (totalSignups < 400) return { tier: 4, price: 30, remaining: 400 - totalSignups };
  if (totalSignups < 500) return { tier: 5, price: 35, remaining: 500 - totalSignups };
  return { tier: 6, price: 49, remaining: 'Unlimited' };
};
```

**CTA Text Dynamic:**
```javascript
const getCTAText = (currentTier, price, platform) => {
  if (currentTier.tier === 6) {
    return platform === 'google'
      ? 'Continue with Google - Get 50% Off Forever'
      : 'Get 50% Off with Email';
  }
  return platform === 'google'
    ? `Continue with Google - Lock In $${price}/month`
    : `Lock In $${price}/month with Email`;
};
```

**Referral Progress Calculation:**
```javascript
const calculateReferralProgress = (user) => {
  const initialTier = user.tier_at_signup;
  const currentTier = getTierInfo(user.position - user.spots_jumped).tier;

  // Can only improve 1 tier from initial
  const targetTier = Math.max(1, initialTier - 1);
  const canStillImprove = currentTier > targetTier;

  if (!canStillImprove) {
    return {
      status: 'max_tier_reached',
      message: `You've unlocked the best pricing available (Tier ${currentTier})!`,
      spotsNeeded: 0
    };
  }

  // Calculate spots needed to reach target tier
  const currentPosition = user.position - user.spots_jumped;
  const targetPosition = targetTier === 1 ? 100 : (targetTier * 100);
  const spotsNeeded = currentPosition - targetPosition;

  return {
    status: 'can_improve',
    currentTier,
    targetTier,
    spotsNeeded,
    referralProgress: {
      friendsReferred: user.referrals.friends_referred,
      socialShares: user.referrals.social_shares,
      totalSpotsJumped: user.spots_jumped
    }
  };
};
```
