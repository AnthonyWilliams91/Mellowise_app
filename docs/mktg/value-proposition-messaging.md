## ðŸ’¬ Objection Handling Scripts

### **"AI can't replace human tutors"**
*"You're right - AI can't replace the emotional support of a human. But for $3/hour vs $200/hour, our AI gives you unlimited practice, instant feedback, and personalized coaching that most human tutors can't match. Plus, you can use the $3,000+ you save for law school."*

### **"I prefer traditional study methods"**
*"We get it! That's why Mellowise includes all traditional features - practice questions, explanations, analytics. The AI and gamification are just bonus features that make studying more effective and enjoyable. You can ignore them if you prefer traditional approaches."*

### **"$89/month seems expensive"**
*"Let's do the math: $89/month = $3/hour for unlimited AI tutoring. A single session with a human tutor costs $200. You'd need to study just 1 hour per week to get better value than any competitor, and 1 hour per month to beat human tutoring costs."*

### **"What if the AI gives wrong answers?"**
*"Great question! Our AI is trained on official LSAT questions and explanations. Every answer is verified by LSAT experts before going live. Plus, you get traditional explanations too - the AI just adds personalized coaching on top."*
