### **Updated FAQ Additions**

**Q: Can I really transfer or sell my lifetime access?**
A: Yes! Starting Epic 5, lifetime accounts include full transferability rights. Transfer to family (1/year), sell on our approved marketplace (10% platform fee), or designate for inheritance. Your investment maintains value.

**Q: How does the scholarship program work?**
A: Lifetime members can contribute to establish named scholarships. Recipients get free Premium+ access, and you can track their progress and success stories through your legacy dashboard.

**Q: What's the advocate earning potential?**
A: Lifetime members earn 30% commission on successful referrals (vs 15% for regular advocates). With our $39-50/month pricing, successful advocates can earn $500-1000+ monthly in passive referral income.

**Q: What if I want to upgrade from advocate status?**
A: We credit your advocate payments toward lifetime purchase. After 6 months of advocate status, you can upgrade to lifetime for just $1,157 (vs $1,497 full price).
