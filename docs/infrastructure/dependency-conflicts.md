## Known Conflicts & Resolutions

### High-Risk Conflicts (Require Immediate Action)

#### 1. Legacy React Router Versions
```json
{
  "conflict": {
    "package": "react-router",
    "problematic_versions": "< 6.8.0",
    "issue": "Performance degradation with React 18 concurrent rendering"
  },
  "resolution": {
    "action": "Upgrade to React Router v6.8+",
    "command": "npm install react-router@^6.8.0 react-router-dom@^6.8.0",
    "validation": "Test navigation performance with concurrent features"
  }
}
```

#### 2. Outdated ESLint React Hooks Plugin
```json
{
  "conflict": {
    "package": "eslint-plugin-react-hooks", 
    "problematic_versions": "< 4.6.0",
    "issue": "Missing React 18 concurrent feature validation"
  },
  "resolution": {
    "action": "Upgrade to version 4.6.0 or higher",
    "command": "npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks@^4.6.0 --save-dev",
    "validation": "Run ESLint with React 18 concurrent components"
  }
}
```

### Medium-Risk Conflicts (Monitor and Plan)

#### 1. Styled Components SSR Issues
```json
{
  "conflict": {
    "package": "styled-components",
    "problematic_versions": "< 5.3.9",
    "issue": "SSR hydration mismatches with React 18 streaming"
  },
  "resolution": {
    "action": "Use Tailwind CSS instead (already selected)",
    "alternative": "If needed, upgrade to styled-components v6.x",
    "validation": "Test SSR hydration with streaming enabled"
  }
}
```

#### 2. React Query Legacy Versions
```json
{
  "conflict": {
    "package": "@tanstack/react-query",
    "problematic_versions": "< 4.32.0",
    "issue": "Missing React 18 Suspense integration"
  },
  "resolution": {
    "action": "Using v5.8.0 - already resolved",
    "validation": "Verify Suspense boundaries work correctly",
    "benefit": "Optimal React 18 concurrent feature support"
  }
}
```

### Low-Risk Conflicts (Monitoring Only)

#### 1. TypeScript Compatibility
```json
{
  "status": "✅ Resolved",
  "package": "typescript",
  "version": "^5.3.0",
  "compatibility": "Excellent React 18 and Next.js 14 support",
  "validation": "Regular type checking with strict mode enabled"
}
```

## Package Lock Strategy

### NPM Lock File Management
```bash
# Ensure consistent installs across environments
npm ci --frozen-lockfile

# Update lock file after dependency changes
npm install --package-lock-only

# Audit for security vulnerabilities
npm audit --audit-level moderate
```

### Version Pinning Strategy
- **Major dependencies**: Pin to minor versions (^14.0.0)
- **Dev dependencies**: Allow patch updates (~4.6.0)
- **Critical security packages**: Pin to exact versions
- **UI libraries**: Pin to minor versions for consistency

## Dependency Validation Workflow

### Pre-installation Checks
```bash
# Check for peer dependency conflicts
npm ls --depth=0

# Validate React/Next.js compatibility
npx next-upgrade-check

# Check for known vulnerabilities
npm audit

# Validate bundle size impact
npx bundlephobia <package-name>
```

### Post-installation Validation
```bash
# Verify TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run linting with React hooks validation
npx eslint . --ext .ts,.tsx

# Test React 18 concurrent features
npm run test:concurrent

# Validate bundle size within budget
npm run analyze:bundle
```

## Automated Conflict Detection

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Dependency Validation
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  dependency-check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        
      - name: Check for peer dependency conflicts
        run: npm ls --depth=0
        
      - name: Audit for vulnerabilities
        run: npm audit --audit-level moderate
        
      - name: Validate React 18 compatibility
        run: npm run test:react18-compat
        
      - name: Bundle size check
        run: npm run check:bundle-size
```

### Runtime Monitoring
- **Error tracking**: Monitor for React 18 concurrent rendering errors
- **Performance monitoring**: Track bundle size and loading performance
- **Compatibility alerts**: Automated notifications for dependency updates

## Migration Strategies

### React 18 Migration Checklist
