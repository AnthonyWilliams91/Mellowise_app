# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Mellowise embodies a "confidence-building companion" design philosophy that transforms the intimidating LSAT preparation experience into an encouraging, game-like journey. The interface should feel like having a supportive AI tutor available 24/7, with warm but professional aesthetics that reduce anxiety while maintaining academic credibility. Visual progress indicators and celebration moments are woven throughout to build momentum and confidence, while the overall experience feels modern, mobile-first, and distinctly different from traditional "corporate" test prep interfaces.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Conversational AI Interface**: Chat-style interactions with the AI tutor feel natural and supportive rather than robotic
- **Progressive Gamification**: Game elements (XP, streaks, levels) are integrated meaningfully into learning rather than superficial overlays
- **Adaptive Feedback Loops**: Interface responds dynamically to user performance with encouragement, difficulty adjustments, and personalized recommendations
- **Swipe-First Mobile Design**: Primary interactions optimized for thumb navigation with card-based layouts for question flow
- **Contextual Assistance**: Help and explanations appear contextually without interrupting flow, with expandable detail levels

## Core Screens and Views

- **Onboarding Flow**: Diagnostic assessment and learning style evaluation
- **Home Dashboard**: Progress overview, streak tracking, and daily recommendations
- **Survival Mode Game**: Full-screen timed game interface with lives, scoring, and leaderboards  
- **Study Session Interface**: Question presentation with integrated AI tutor chat
- **Progress Analytics**: Detailed performance tracking with visual charts and predictions
- **AI Tutor Chat**: Dedicated conversation interface for questions and explanations
- **Settings & Profile**: Subscription management, notifications, and personalization preferences

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

The platform will meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure inclusive access, including screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, color contrast compliance, and alternative text for visual elements. This is essential for the education market and aligns with our democratization mission.

## Branding

Mellowise's visual identity should convey "intelligent confidence" - combining the reliability of academic achievement with the approachability of modern consumer apps. Color palette emphasizes calming blues and confidence-building greens, with energetic accent colors for gamification elements. Typography balances readability with personality, avoiding both sterile corporate and overly casual aesthetics. Visual metaphors focus on growth, progress, and achievement rather than stress or competition.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on mobile-responsive web application optimized for smartphones (where 65% of study sessions occur) while maintaining full functionality on tablets and desktop. Progressive Web App (PWA) features enable app-like experience without native development costs, supporting offline mode for previously accessed content and push notifications for study reminders.
