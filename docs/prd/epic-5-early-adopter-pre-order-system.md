# Epic 5: Early Adopter Pre-Order System

**Updated**: October 21, 2025 at 4:30 PM EST

## Epic Goal
Establish a viral pre-order landing page with dynamic tiered pricing that converts visitors into paying early adopters by creating urgency through scarcity mechanics, while delivering beta access exclusively to pre-order customers and managing their lifecycle from pre-order through launch and subscription activation.

## Key Dates
- **Beta Launch**: December 1, 2025 (exclusive to pre-order customers)
- **Official Launch**: January 1, 2026
- **First Billing**: April 1, 2026 (3 months after launch)

## Story 5.1: Early Adopter Database Schema & Tier Management

**As a system,**
**I want to track early adopter signups with tier-locked pricing and beta access entitlements,**
**so that I can manage pre-orders, enforce pricing tiers, and provision beta access correctly.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **`early_adopter_tiers` table created** with fields: tier_id, tier_name, monthly_price, upfront_price (3 months), capacity, current_count, is_active
2. **6 pricing tiers seeded** into database:
   - Tier 1: $15/month, $45 upfront, 100 capacity
   - Tier 2: $20/month, $60 upfront, 100 capacity
   - Tier 3: $25/month, $75 upfront, 100 capacity
   - Tier 4: $30/month, $90 upfront, 100 capacity
   - Tier 5: $35/month, $105 upfront, 100 capacity
   - Tier 6: $49/month, $147 upfront, unlimited capacity
3. **`early_adopter_signups` table created** with fields: user_id, email, tier_locked, monthly_rate, upfront_payment_amount, stripe_customer_id, stripe_subscription_id, payment_status, beta_access_date (default: 2025-12-01), billing_start_date (default: 2026-04-01), reservation_token, reservation_expires_at
4. **`tier_transitions_log` table created** for audit trail of tier progressions
5. **Database indexes** created on: user_id, email, tier_locked, payment_status, beta_access_date
6. **Automatic tier advancement trigger** implemented: when current_count reaches capacity, next tier activates
7. **Supabase migration file** created and tested locally with sample data
8. **RPC function** `increment_tier_count` created for atomic tier count updates

## Story 5.2: Current Tier API with Real-Time Updates

**As a visitor,**
**I want to see the current pricing tier and available spots in real-time,**
**so that I understand the urgency and can make an informed decision.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **`GET /api/early-adopter/current-tier` endpoint** returns: current_tier, monthly_price, upfront_price, spots_remaining, capacity, next_tier_price, spots_until_next_tier
2. **Edge caching** implemented with 5-second TTL to reduce database load
3. **Tier calculation logic** finds first tier with available capacity, falls back to Tier 6 if all full
4. **Next.js API route** at `src/app/api/early-adopter/current-tier/route.ts` implemented
5. **FastAPI backend route** at `backend/api/early_adopter/routes.py` implemented
6. **Error handling** for database connection failures with fallback response
7. **Response time** under 100ms (excluding edge cache cold start)
8. **Integration test** verifies tier progression when capacity reached

## Story 5.3: Spot Reservation System

**As a prospective early adopter,**
**I want my spot reserved while I complete checkout,**
**so that the tier doesn't change while I'm entering payment information.**

### Acceptance Criteria
1. **`POST /api/early-adopter/reserve-spot` endpoint** accepts email and returns reservation_token
2. **10-minute reservation window** enforced via reservation_expires_at timestamp
3. **Cryptographically secure token** generated using `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`
4. **Reservation record** created with payment_status='reserved' (doesn't count toward tier capacity)
5. **Duplicate email check** prevents multiple active reservations for same email
6. **Expired reservations** automatically cleaned up via cron job (runs hourly)
7. **Reservation response** includes: token, tier, monthly_price, upfront_price, expires_at
8. **Rate limiting** enforced: 5 reservations per IP per minute

## Story 5.4: Stripe Pre-Order Payment Integration

**As a prospective early adopter,**
**I want to securely pay for my 3-month pre-order,**
**so that I can lock in my tier pricing and receive beta access on December 1st.**

2. **`POST /api/early-adopter/complete-signup` endpoint** accepts reservation_token and stripe_payment_intent_id

   - Price ID corresponding to locked monthly rate
5. **Reservation upgraded** to payment_status='completed' after successful payment
6. **Tier count incremented** atomically using `increment_tier_count` RPC
7. **Welcome email sent** via Resend with:
   - Confirmation of tier locked
   - Beta access date (December 1, 2025)
   - Billing start date (April 1, 2026)
   - Subscription details
8. **Webhook endpoint** `/api/webhooks/stripe/early-adopter` handles payment failures and refunds
9. **Idempotency** ensures duplicate payments don't create multiple subscriptions
10. **Error handling** for expired reservations returns 'RESERVATION_EXPIRED' error code

## Implementation Notes

### Critical Billing Logic
- **Upfront Payment**: $[TIER_PRICE √ó 3] charged today
- **Beta Access**: December 1, 2025 (free, 1 month)
- **Official Launch**: January 1, 2026 (3-month pre-order period starts)
- **First Billing**: April 1, 2026 (monthly subscription billing begins)
- **Total Value**: 4 months of access for price of 3 months

### Beta Access Restriction
**CRITICAL**: Beta access is ONLY available to users who complete pre-order payment. Non-paying users cannot access beta and must wait until January 1, 2026 launch at $99/month.

### Stripe Integration Requirements
1. Create 6 price IDs (recurring monthly)
2. Set `billing_cycle_anchor` to April 1, 2026 for all subscriptions
3. Include comprehensive metadata for tracking
4. Configure Customer Portal with restricted permissions

### Key Metrics
- **Target**: 500 signups across tiers 1-5 (100 each)
- **Conversion Rate Goal**: 25%+ (visitors ‚Üí pre-orders)
- **Projected MRR**: $7,500 (assuming 500 signups, 60% activation)
- **Projected ARR**: $90,000
