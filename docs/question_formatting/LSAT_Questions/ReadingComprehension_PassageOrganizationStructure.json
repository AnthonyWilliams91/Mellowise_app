As AI systems become more sophisticated and widespread, policymakers worldwide are grappling with how to harness their benefits while mitigating potential risks.\\n\\nThe European Union has taken the lead with its comprehensive AI Act, which categorizes AI systems by risk level and imposes corresponding regulatory requirements. High-risk applications face strict oversight, while low-risk applications enjoy greater regulatory freedom.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the United States has favored a more flexible, sector-specific approach, with different agencies regulating AI applications in their respective domains. This approach has both advantages and drawbacks.\\n\\nThe challenge for all jurisdictions is balancing innovation with protection. The coming years will likely determine whether current regulatory approaches are sufficient."
