# Mellowise Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Launch MVP LSAT prep platform within 3 months on $150-200 budget
- Achieve 500 early adopter pre-orders at $30/month lifetime rate 
- Deliver first AI-native LSAT prep with personalized learning that adapts to individual learning styles
- Transform test anxiety into confidence through systematic gamified exposure therapy
- Provide data-driven readiness scoring that gives students confidence they're prepared
- Establish freemium model with 3-5% conversion rate from free to paid users
- Achieve 15% average score improvement for users who complete the program
- Achieve 4.8+ app store rating (vs competitor average of 4.2)
- Maintain 85% 3-month retention rate vs industry average of 60%
- Build foundation for multi-exam expansion (GRE, GMAT, MCAT) in months 6-18

### Background Context

The standardized test prep market represents a $2.1B opportunity in the US, with LSAT preparation alone accounting for $180M annually. Despite this large market, current solutions suffer from critical competitive gaps: they're expensive ($69-300/month for digital solutions), lack true AI personalization, provide poor mobile experiences, and completely fail to address test anxiety - a pain point affecting 78% of test takers that no competitor systematically addresses.

Mellowise exploits these market gaps as the first AI-native LSAT prep platform, combining deep learning personalization with test anxiety desensitization through gamification. Unlike competitors who retrofit basic adaptive features onto legacy platforms, our AI-first architecture enables continuous improvement and true personalization. The platform's "Survival Mode" game serves as both a viral acquisition hook and therapeutic tool for building confidence under pressure, addressing the anxiety management void in the current market. By targeting the underserved $30-60/month pricing segment with superior personalization and 24/7 availability, Mellowise can capture significant market share while democratizing access to high-quality test preparation.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Mellowise embodies a "confidence-building companion" design philosophy that transforms the intimidating LSAT preparation experience into an encouraging, game-like journey. The interface should feel like having a supportive AI tutor available 24/7, with warm but professional aesthetics that reduce anxiety while maintaining academic credibility. Visual progress indicators and celebration moments are woven throughout to build momentum and confidence, while the overall experience feels modern, mobile-first, and distinctly different from traditional "corporate" test prep interfaces.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Conversational AI Interface**: Chat-style interactions with the AI tutor feel natural and supportive rather than robotic
- **Progressive Gamification**: Game elements (XP, streaks, levels) are integrated meaningfully into learning rather than superficial overlays
- **Adaptive Feedback Loops**: Interface responds dynamically to user performance with encouragement, difficulty adjustments, and personalized recommendations
- **Swipe-First Mobile Design**: Primary interactions optimized for thumb navigation with card-based layouts for question flow
- **Contextual Assistance**: Help and explanations appear contextually without interrupting flow, with expandable detail levels

### Core Screens and Views

- **Onboarding Flow**: Diagnostic assessment and learning style evaluation
- **Home Dashboard**: Progress overview, streak tracking, and daily recommendations
- **Survival Mode Game**: Full-screen timed game interface with lives, scoring, and leaderboards  
- **Study Session Interface**: Question presentation with integrated AI tutor chat
- **Progress Analytics**: Detailed performance tracking with visual charts and predictions
- **AI Tutor Chat**: Dedicated conversation interface for questions and explanations
- **Settings & Profile**: Subscription management, notifications, and personalization preferences

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

The platform will meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure inclusive access, including screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, color contrast compliance, and alternative text for visual elements. This is essential for the education market and aligns with our democratization mission.

### Branding

Mellowise's visual identity should convey "intelligent confidence" - combining the reliability of academic achievement with the approachability of modern consumer apps. Color palette emphasizes calming blues and confidence-building greens, with energetic accent colors for gamification elements. Typography balances readability with personality, avoiding both sterile corporate and overly casual aesthetics. Visual metaphors focus on growth, progress, and achievement rather than stress or competition.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive

Primary focus on mobile-responsive web application optimized for smartphones (where 65% of study sessions occur) while maintaining full functionality on tablets and desktop. Progressive Web App (PWA) features enable app-like experience without native development costs, supporting offline mode for previously accessed content and push notifications for study reminders.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository structure containing both frontend and backend code to simplify development workflow, reduce complexity, and enable easier coordination between components during rapid MVP development. This approach minimizes overhead while maintaining clear separation of concerns through folder structure.

### Service Architecture

**Monolithic Web Application with Serverless Functions**: Core application deployed as a single unit with specific AI and processing-intensive tasks handled by serverless functions. This hybrid approach balances simplicity (monolith benefits) with scalability (serverless for expensive operations like AI question generation). Rationale: Reduces operational complexity while controlling costs through serverless auto-scaling for AI workloads.

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing**: Comprehensive unit testing for business logic and integration testing for API endpoints and database interactions. Given the bootstrap timeline, focus on critical path testing (authentication, payment processing, AI algorithms, progress tracking) rather than exhaustive coverage. Manual testing protocols for user workflows complement automated testing.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

- **Structured JSON** for flexible user progress and analytics storage
- **Indexed performance tracking** for efficient analytics queries

**Deployment and Infrastructure:**
- **Vercel** for frontend hosting (free tier, optimal Next.js integration)
- **Railway/Render** for backend API hosting (free tier with scaling options)
- **Cloudinary** for asset storage (PDFs, images) - free tier sufficient for MVP
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD pipeline automation

**AI Cost Optimization Strategy:**
- **Intelligent Caching**: Redis (Upstash free tier) for caching common AI responses
- **Response Templating**: Pre-generate common explanations to reduce API calls
- **Progressive Throttling**: Rate limiting based on budget thresholds
- **Model Selection**: Claude Haiku for simple tasks, GPT-3.5-turbo for medium complexity

**Security and Compliance:**
- **FERPA-compliant data handling** with encrypted storage and transmission
- **JWT-based authentication** with secure session management
- **Environment-based configuration** to protect API keys and sensitive data
- **Regular automated security scanning** integrated into CI/CD pipeline

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Code splitting** and lazy loading for optimal mobile performance
- **Progressive Web App** features for app-like experience
- **CDN optimization** for global content delivery
- **Database query optimization** with proper indexing strategy

**Development Workflow:**
- **Git-based version control** with feature branching strategy

## Next Steps

### UX Expert Prompt

"Review the Mellowise PRD focusing on the UI/UX design goals and user experience requirements. Create comprehensive UX architecture including wireframes, user flows, and interaction design specifications that bring the 'confidence-building companion' vision to life while ensuring mobile-first optimization and WCAG AA accessibility compliance."

### Architect Prompt

"Using the Mellowise PRD technical assumptions and epic details, create a comprehensive technical architecture document detailing the Next.js/Supabase/FastAPI implementation, database schema design, AI integration patterns, and deployment strategy that supports 1000+ concurrent users within the $150-200 MVP budget constraints."
