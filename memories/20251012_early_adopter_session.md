### Features to Implement:

#### 1. Problem Section (Social Proof)

Test prep companies charge $2,000+ for courses that:
❌ Use the same lessons for everyone
❌ Don't track what YOU actually struggle with

The average LSAT student spends $1,500-$3,500 on prep.
What if there was a better way?

## ✅ Homepage Updates - Phase 2 (October 12, 2025 Evening)

**Updated**: October 12, 2025 at 7:30 PM EST

### Implemented Updates:

1. **Centered Solution Section Headings** ✅
   - Centered "THE SOLUTION" main heading
   - Centered "AI That Actually Knows You" subheading
   - File: `app/home/page.tsx` (lines 495, 498)

2. **Updated FAQ: Cancellation Policy** ✅
   - **New Policy**: Early adopter rate is locked in for LIFE—even if you cancel
   - **Key Detail**: As long as you don't delete your account, you can reactivate at original tier pricing anytime
   - **Warning**: Delete your account = lose your rate forever
   - File: `app/home/page.tsx` (lines 48-50)

3. **Updated FAQ: Tier Upgrade Mechanics** ✅
   - **New Title**: "Can I upgrade to a better tier if I join late?"
   - **Three Upgrade Methods**:
     1. **Affiliate Sharing**: Every 3 signups = 10 seats closer to next tier
     2. **Social Media Sharing**: 5 seats per platform
     3. **6-Month Purchase**: Pay 6 months upfront → billing drops to next lower tier after July 2026 (6 months from official launch)
   - File: `app/home/page.tsx` (lines 68-70)

### Technical Details:

- **Accordion Component Location**: Moved from `./components/ui/accordion.tsx` to `./src/components/ui/accordion.tsx`
  - Reason: Project uses `@/` path alias pointing to `./src/*` in tsconfig.json
  - All other UI components (particles, gradient-text) are in `src/components/ui/`

- **Dev Server**: Successfully restarted and compiled
  - Page accessible at: http://localhost:3000/home
  - All routes working correctly
  - No compilation errors

### Business Logic Clarifications:

1. **Lifetime Rate Lock**: Users keep their early adopter rate even after cancellation (as long as account exists)
2. **Tier Upgrade Path**: Multiple methods to move to better pricing tiers after initial signup
3. **Social Sharing Incentives**: Built-in viral mechanics for tier upgrades
4. **6-Month Commitment Upgrade**: Alternative to social sharing for guaranteed tier improvement
