**Session Date:** September 30, 2025
**Session Type:** Multi-Agent Planning & Specification
**Feature:** Viral Waitlist Landing Page with Tiered Pricing & Referral System
**Status:** Planning Complete - Ready for Implementation

---

## 📋 **Session Overview**

**Objective:** Design and plan a complete waitlist landing page system to collect 500+ beta signups with viral referral mechanics.

**Agents Involved:**
- 🎭 **BMad Orchestrator** - Coordinated multi-agent collaboration
- 🎨 **Sally (UX Expert)** - UI/UX specifications and design system

---

## 🎯 **Business Context**

### **Challenge**
Mellowise needs to validate market demand and build an early user base before beta launch. Traditional landing pages have low conversion rates (~5-10%).

### **Solution**
Create a viral waitlist system with:
- **Tiered pricing** that creates urgency (first 100 users get $15/month vs $99 regular)
- **Referral mechanics** that incentivize sharing (3 friends = 10 spots jumped)
- **Social proof** through real-time counter showing tier availability
- **1-tier improvement cap** to prevent gaming the system

### **Expected Outcomes**
- 500+ waitlist signups in first 30 days
- 15%+ referral participation rate
- 25%+ visitor-to-signup conversion rate
- Viral coefficient (K-factor) of 1.2+
- Projected MRR: $7,500/month ($90K ARR)

---

## 📚 **Deliverables Created**

### **1. Front-End Specification**
**File:** `docs/front-end-spec-landing-page.md`
**Agent:** Sally (UX Expert)
**Sections:** 12 major sections, 50+ subsections
**Page Count:** ~25 pages

**Key Contents:**
- User personas (LSAT students, busy professionals, institution decision-makers)
- Information architecture (site map, navigation)
- User flows (waitlist signup, browse without signup)
- Wireframes (desktop + mobile layouts)
- Component library (shadcn/ui: navbar-01, button, input, input-button)
- Branding & style guide (colors, typography, spacing)
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Responsiveness strategy (4 breakpoints: mobile, tablet, desktop, wide)
- Animation & micro-interactions
- Performance goals (< 2s load time, 60fps animations)
- Playwright test cases (5 critical user flows)

**Design Decisions:**
- ✅ Sana AI-inspired split-screen layout (60/40 ratio)
- ✅ Mobile-first approach (60%+ traffic expected from mobile)
- ✅ Premium, aspirational positioning (not aggressive/disruptor)
- ✅ Standard form over animated input-button (simpler for MVP)
- ✅ Focus on clarity over cleverness

---

### **2. Marketing Copy & Conversion Strategy**
**File:** `docs/marketing-copy-landing-page.md`
**Agent:** Alex (Marketing Specialist)
**Sections:** 9 major sections
**Copy Blocks:** 100+ pieces of production-ready copy

**Key Contents:**
- Landing page copy (headlines, subheadlines, CTAs, pricing widget, FAQ)
- Success page copy (confirmation, referral tools, progress tracking)
- Email sequence (4 emails: welcome, engagement, progress, beta launch)
- Social sharing copy (pre-written for 5 platforms: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn)
- Referral mechanics documentation (12 detailed scenarios)
- Conversion funnel optimization strategy
- A/B testing roadmap
- Analytics & tracking requirements

**Key Marketing Decisions:**
- ✅ **Value Proposition:** "Welcome to Mellowise - AI-powered LSAT prep that adapts to you" (Option B: Premium/aspirational)
- ✅ **Beta Positioning:** Embrace "Early Access" language (creates exclusivity without "beta" stigma)
- ✅ **Social Proof:** Start without counter, add once 250+ signups achieved
- ✅ **Pricing Transparency:** Show tiered pricing on landing page with "lock your rate now" messaging
- ✅ **Tiered Pricing Strategy:**
  - Tier 1 (0-100): $15/month
  - Tier 2 (101-200): $20/month
  - Tier 3 (201-300): $25/month
  - Tier 4 (301-400): $30/month
  - Tier 5 (401-500): $35/month
  - Tier 6 (501+): $49/month (50% off $99 forever)

**Referral Mechanics Finalized:**
- **Friend Referrals:** 3 friends = 10 spots jumped (unlimited batches)
- **Social Shares:** 5 spots per platform (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn - once each)
- **Max Social Spots:** 25 spots (5 platforms × 5 spots)
- **Tier Improvement Cap:** 1 tier max from initial signup tier
- **Position Tracking:** Jumps are "pricing tier" only, activation queue position stays same
- **Example:** User at position #127 (Tier 2: $20/month) refers 9 friends → Jumps 30 spots → Unlocks Tier 1 pricing ($15/month), but still #127 in activation queue

---

### **3. Technical Architecture**
**File:** `docs/architecture-waitlist-system.md`
**Agent:** Winston (Architect)
**Sections:** 13 major sections + appendix
**Technical Depth:** Complete system design with code examples

**Key Contents:**
- System architecture overview (integrated into main Mellowise app)
- Database schema (4 tables: waitlist_users, referrals, social_shares, email_events)
- API endpoints (6 Next.js API routes + 5 FastAPI endpoints)
- Referral tracking system logic
- Email automation (Resend + React Email templates)
- Anti-fraud & security measures
- Performance optimization strategies
- Deployment architecture (Vercel + Railway + Supabase + Resend)
- Monitoring & analytics setup
- Migration path to beta activation

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- ✅ **System Placement:** Integrated into main app (not microservice) - simpler deployment, easier user transition
- ✅ **Counter Strategy:** Polling (5-second updates) - simpler than WebSocket, good enough for MVP
- ✅ **Email Service:** Resend - Modern API, React Email templates, great developer experience
- ✅ **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL (existing) - No new infrastructure needed
- ✅ **Caching:** 5-second edge caching for counter endpoint (reduces DB queries 1000x)

**Database Schema Highlights:**
```sql
-- 4 main tables
waitlist_users (position, tier tracking, referral code, fraud flags)
referrals (referrer → referred relationships, batch tracking)
social_shares (platform tracking, click verification, spots awarded)
email_events (Resend tracking, opens, clicks, bounces)

-- Key indexes for performance
idx_waitlist_users_position
idx_waitlist_users_referral_code
idx_referrals_referrer_id
```

**API Endpoints:**
- `POST /api/waitlist/signup` - Handle signups (Google OAuth + email)
- `GET /api/waitlist/counter` - Live tier count (5s polling)
- `POST /api/waitlist/referral` - Process referrals
- `POST /api/waitlist/social-share` - Track social shares
- `GET /api/verify-email` - Email verification
- `POST /api/webhooks/resend` - Email event tracking

**Anti-Fraud Measures:**
- IP-based fraud detection (multiple signups from same IP flagged)
- Disposable email blocking (Mailinator, 10minutemail, etc.)
- Rate limiting (10 req/min per IP for signup)
- Referral batch validation (same IP pattern detection)
- Email verification for all email signups (OAuth auto-verified)

## 🔑 **Key Decisions & Rationale**

### **UX Decisions (Sally)**

**1. Split-Screen Layout (Sana AI Pattern)**
- **Decision:** 60/40 split (form left, product preview right)
- **Rationale:** Proven pattern for AI/SaaS products, provides visual proof while keeping form prominent
- **Mobile:** Stack vertically (form on top)

**2. Pricing Transparency**
- **Decision:** Show all 6 tiers on landing page with live counter
- **Rationale:** Creates urgency through scarcity, builds trust through transparency
- **Alternative rejected:** Hide pricing (reduces conversion)

**3. Component Selection**
- **Decision:** Use standard form over animated input-button
- **Rationale:** Simpler to implement, proven pattern, can A/B test later
- **Components chosen:** shadcn/ui navbar-01, button, input

**4. Mobile-First Design**
- **Decision:** Optimize for mobile (4 breakpoints)
- **Rationale:** 60%+ traffic expected from mobile for education products
- **Approach:** Responsive design with progressive enhancement

---

### **Marketing Decisions (Alex)**

**1. Value Proposition**
- **Decision:** "Welcome to Mellowise - AI-powered LSAT prep that adapts to you"
- **Rationale:** Premium positioning matches Sana AI design, aspirational not aggressive
- **Alternatives rejected:** Problem-focused ("Stop wasting money") too negative, Outcome-focused ("Master LSAT") too generic

**2. Tiered Pricing Strategy**
- **Decision:** 5 early-bird tiers ($15-$35) + perpetual 50% off tier ($49)
- **Rationale:** Creates FOMO, rewards early supporters proportionally, maintains value at 501+
- **Lock-in:** Price locked on signup (builds massive trust and urgency)

**3. Referral Mechanics**
- **Decision:** 3 friends = 10 spots, 1 social share = 5 spots, 1-tier cap
- **Rationale:** Balanced between viral growth and fairness, prevents gaming
- **Innovation:** Spots jumped affect pricing only (not activation queue) - fair to all users

**4. Social Platforms**
- **Decision:** Support 5 platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn)
- **Rationale:** Covers all major social channels for students + professionals
- **Max reward:** 25 spots from social (5 platforms × 5 spots)

**5. Email Strategy**
- **Decision:** 4-email sequence (welcome, engagement, progress, beta launch)
- **Rationale:** Nurture leads, encourage referrals, maintain engagement until beta
- **Service:** Resend for modern DX and React Email template support

---

### **Architecture Decisions (Winston)**

**1. System Integration**
- **Decision:** Integrate waitlist into main Mellowise app (not microservice)
- **Rationale:** Simpler deployment, shared auth/database, easier user transition to beta
- **Trade-off:** Couples waitlist to main app, but acceptable for MVP

**2. Real-Time Counter**
- **Decision:** Polling (5-second updates) over WebSocket
- **Rationale:** Much simpler to implement, 5s delay negligible for waitlist counter, works on all platforms
- **Performance:** 5s edge caching reduces DB load 1000x (200 req/s → 0.2 req/s)

**3. Email Service**
- **Decision:** Resend over SendGrid or Mailchimp
- **Rationale:** Modern API, React Email template support, excellent DX, free tier sufficient for MVP
- **Cost:** Free for 100 emails/day (sufficient for testing), $20/month for 50K emails

**4. Database Design**
- **Decision:** 4 normalized tables with proper indexes
- **Rationale:** Supports complex referral queries, tracks all events, enables analytics
- **Performance:** Strategic indexes on position, email, referral_code for fast lookups

**5. Anti-Fraud Strategy**
- **Decision:** Multi-layer defense (IP tracking, disposable email blocking, rate limiting, manual review queue)
- **Rationale:** Referral systems are targets for abuse, need comprehensive protection
- **Balance:** Automated detection + human review for edge cases

---

### **Implementation Decisions (James)**

**1. Timeline Approach**
- **Decision:** 3 weeks for full feature set (solo developer)
- **Rationale:** User wants production-ready system, not MVP prototype
- **Alternative rejected:** 2-week MVP (missing social sharing, advanced fraud detection)

**2. Week-by-Week Strategy**
- **Week 1:** Foundation (database, UI, basic signup)
- **Week 2:** Features (referrals, social, emails, fraud)
- **Week 3:** Quality (testing, performance, security, launch)
- **Rationale:** Build solid foundation, add features, polish for production

**3. Testing Strategy**
- **Decision:** Playwright for E2E tests + unit tests for business logic
- **Rationale:** Playwright tests critical user flows, unit tests ensure tier calculation correctness
- **Coverage:** 5 critical flows (signup via OAuth, signup via email, referral, tier jump, mobile nav)

**4. Launch Approach**
- **Decision:** Staging review → Production deploy → Monitor
- **Rationale:** Stakeholder approval before launch, gradual rollout reduces risk
- **Post-launch:** Monitor analytics daily, respond to fraud attempts, iterate based on data

---

## 📈 **Viral Growth Mechanics**

### **Referral Loop Design**
```
User Signs Up
     ↓
Receives Referral Link
     ↓
Shares with Friends (incentivized by tier upgrade)
     ↓
Friends Sign Up (personal recommendation = high trust)
     ↓
Original User Gets Rewarded (10 spots per 3 friends)
     ↓
Tier Unlocked → User Shares More → Cycle Continues
```

### **Viral Coefficient Calculation**
```
K = (% who refer) × (avg referrals per user) × (referral conversion rate)

Target K-factor: 1.2+
Assumptions:
- 15% of users refer at least 1 friend
- Average 2.5 referrals per active referrer
- 80% conversion rate (referred friends sign up)

K = 0.15 × 2.5 × 0.80 = 0.30 (current baseline)

To reach K > 1.0 (viral growth):
- Increase participation to 25% OR
- Increase avg referrals to 5+ OR
- Maintain high conversion (80%+)

Strategy: Focus on increasing participation through email nudges + success page optimization
```

### **Growth Projection (K = 1.2)**
```
Week 1: 100 organic signups → 120 total (20 via referrals)
Week 2: 120 organic → 144 total
Week 3: 144 organic → 173 total
Week 4: 173 organic → 208 total
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Month 1 Total: ~650 waitlist members
```

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

### **Playwright E2E Tests (5 Critical Flows)**
1. User can sign up via Google OAuth
2. User can sign up via email
3. Invalid email shows validation error
4. Referral flow works (user A refers user B)
5. Mobile navigation works correctly

### **Unit Tests**
- Tier calculation logic (boundary testing: position 100, 101, 200, 201, etc.)
- Referral spot calculation (3 friends = 10 spots)
- 1-tier cap enforcement (Tier 5 can't jump to Tier 1)
- Email validation (disposable email detection)

### **Performance Tests**
- Page load < 2 seconds (Lighthouse LCP)
- Counter polling doesn't spike DB load
- 1000 concurrent users (load testing with loader.io)

### **Accessibility Tests**
- axe DevTools: 0 WCAG violations
- Keyboard navigation: All flows accessible via Tab/Enter
- Screen reader: VoiceOver/NVDA compatibility
