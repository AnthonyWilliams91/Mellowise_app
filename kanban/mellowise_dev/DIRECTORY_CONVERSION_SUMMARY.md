# Kanban Directory Conversion Summary

**Date**: September 13, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Kanban system converted to directory-based structure

## 🎯 **Conversion Objectives Achieved**

### ✅ **1. Directory Structure Created**

- **Created**: `/kanban/mellowise_dev/backlog/`, `/in_progress/`, `/review/`, `/done/`
- **Format**: Individual `.md` files with embedded JSON metadata
- **Organization**: Each card gets its own dedicated file

### ✅ **2. Card Extraction Completed**

- **Backlog**: 6 cards extracted (MELLOWISE-011, 016, 013, 014, 015, 003C)
- **In Progress**: Empty (no cards currently in progress)
- **Review**: Empty (all completed cards moved to done)
- **Done**: 6 key cards extracted (MELLOWISE-012, 009, 010, 001, 003A, 005, 007)

### ✅ **3. Enhanced Card Format**

Each card now includes:

- **JSON Metadata**: Complete card definition with all metadata
- **Markdown Content**: User story, acceptance criteria, technical approach
- **Implementation Details**: Files created, success metrics, integration features
- **Dependency Tracking**: Clear prerequisite relationships

## 🎯 **Card Format Standardization**

### **JSON Metadata Block**

```json
{
  "id": "MELLOWISE-XXX",
  "title": "Card Title",
  "epic": "Epic Name",
  "phase": "Phase Number",
  "owner": "Responsible Agent(s)",
  "created_date": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
  "started_date": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
  "completed_date": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
  "status": "backlog|in_progress|review|done",
  "priority": "high|medium|low",
  "story_points": 8,
  "description": "User story description",
  "acceptance_criteria": [...],
  "technical_approach": [...],
  "dependencies": [...],
  "tags": [...]
}
```

### **Markdown Content Structure**
