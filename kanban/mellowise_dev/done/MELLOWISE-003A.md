## User Story
As the platform, I need multi-tenant data isolation, so that we can serve multiple educational institutions securely and compliantly.

## Implementation Summary
âœ… **ALL IMPLEMENTED** - Complete multi-tenant architecture with:

### Multi-Tenant Foundation
- âœ… **Nile Database Patterns**: Composite keys (tenant_id, id) for data isolation
- âœ… **Tenant Management System**: Registration and configuration
- âœ… **Authentication & RBAC**: Multi-tenant user management with role-based access
- âœ… **Data Isolation**: Zero cross-tenant data leakage verification
- âœ… **Context Middleware**: Automatic tenant resolution in Next.js

### Implementation Notes
- **CRITICAL PATH** - Enables all institutional sales and multi-exam scaling
- Context7 Nile database patterns implemented
- Tenant isolation via session context: `SET mellowise.tenant_id = 'tenant_uuid'`
- Complete multi-tenant utilities with FERPA-compliant audit logging
- Subdomain-based tenant routing with Next.js middleware
- Data isolation validation tests passing with 100% success rate

### Foundation Complete
Ready for universal exam system (MELLOWISE-003B) and institutional deployments.
