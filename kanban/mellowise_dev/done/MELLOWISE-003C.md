## User Story
As an educational institution, I need FERPA-compliant data protection, so that student educational records are encrypted and access is properly audited per federal regulations.

## Implementation Summary
âœ… **ALL IMPLEMENTED** - Complete FERPA compliance system with:

### Data Protection Features
- âœ… **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM with tenant-specific keys (AWS KMS)
- âœ… **PII Protection**: Field-level encryption for sensitive student data
- âœ… **Audit Logging**: Enhanced FERPA compliance tracking with PII masking
- âœ… **Consent Management**: Student consent system with parent/guardian support
- âœ… **Data Rights**: Access, deletion, and correction request workflows
- âœ… **Data Retention**: Automated 7-year FERPA retention compliance

### Technical Implementation
