## Agent Team Workflow Protocol

### **🚨 CRITICAL: Agent Team Continuity Process**

When a card moves between statuses (backlog → in_progress → review → done), **the agent team assignments and responsibilities MUST be carried forward**:

1. **Moving to IN_PROGRESS**: Copy the entire **Agent Team** and **Lead Responsibilities** sections from this backlog README.md to the in_progress README.md
2. **Moving to REVIEW**: Copy the **Agent Team** and **Lead Responsibilities** sections to the review README.md
3. **Moving to DONE**: Copy the **Agent Team** and **Lead Responsibilities** sections to the done README.md for permanent record

### **Agent Team Assignment Benefits**

- **Complete Coverage**: Architecture, implementation, user experience, and quality perspectives on every card
- **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent contributes their core competencies for maximum feature quality
- **Risk Mitigation**: Multiple perspectives catch issues early, reducing technical debt and rework
- **User Focus**: UX Expert ensures features remain user-centric while technical agents ensure feasibility
- **Quality Assurance**: QA involvement from start prevents issues rather than catching them late
- **Perfect Record**: Maintain accountability and coordination history for every card

### **Usage Instructions**

Before starting any card implementation:
1. ✅ Run `./kanban/workflow-check.sh CARD-ID` to validate workflow status
2. ✅ Reference the **Agent Team** and **Lead Responsibilities** for that card from the current status README.md
3. ✅ Coordinate with the recommended agents using `*agent [agent-name]` commands
4. ✅ Follow the lead responsibilities to ensure comprehensive coverage
5. ✅ When moving the card, **copy agent team info to the destination README.md**

**🎯 This systematic approach ensures every card gets thorough, professional treatment across all dimensions of software delivery.**
