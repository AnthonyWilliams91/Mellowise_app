## User Story
As a student wanting long-term retention, I want intelligent review scheduling, so that I remember concepts for test day, not just the next session.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Forgetting curve calculation for each concept
- [ ] Optimal review interval determination using SM-2 algorithm
- [ ] Priority queue balancing new content with reviews
- [ ] Mastery levels (Learning, Young, Mature, Master)
- [ ] Review load balancing preventing overwhelming sessions
- [ ] Concept dependency awareness ensuring prerequisites
- [ ] Pre-test intensive review mode focusing on high-impact refreshers
- [ ] Performance tracking showing retention rates over time

## Technical Approach
1. Implement forgetting curve calculation algorithms for individual concepts
