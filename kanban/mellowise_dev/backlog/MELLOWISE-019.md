## User Story
As an LSAT student, I want targeted practice for different logical reasoning question types, so that I can improve my critical thinking skills systematically.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Question type classification: Strengthen/Weaken, Assumption, Flaw, etc.
- [ ] Argument structure visualization highlighting premises and conclusions
- [ ] Common wrong answer pattern identification
- [ ] Timed practice mode with per-question time recommendations
- [ ] Difficulty progression within each question type
- [ ] Performance tracking by question type
- [ ] Custom practice sets based on weakness areas
- [ ] Detailed explanation system for all answer choices

## Technical Approach
1. Build question type classification system with automated tagging
2. Create argument structure visualization with premise/conclusion highlighting
3. Implement wrong answer pattern detection and analysis
4. Design timed practice mode with intelligent time recommendations
5. Build difficulty progression system within question types
6. Create performance tracking dashboard by question type
