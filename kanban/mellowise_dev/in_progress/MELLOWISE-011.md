### Recommendation System Architecture Decision
**Reference**: `docs/architecture/recommendation-systems-analysis.md`

**Decision Summary**: After comprehensive multi-agent evaluation (Architect, UX Expert, Product Owner, Analyst), **Sequential Recommendation** system selected as optimal foundation with Context-aware enhancement.

**Key Findings**:
- **100% Agent Consensus**: Sequential Recommendation for educational progression modeling
- **Technical Fit**: Perfect integration with existing FSRS difficulty system and learning style assessment
- **Expected Impact**: 25% improvement in learning effectiveness, 40% session completion increase
- **Implementation**: Internal development with BMad Agent coordination (budget-friendly approach)

**Framework**: [RecBole](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/RecBole) recommendation system library
**Strategy**: Phased implementation starting with Sequential foundation, enhanced with Context-aware features

### Implementation Approach
**Local RTX 3090 Development Strategy**:
- **Hardware Available**: RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM) on Windows desktop for ML training
- **Development Setup**: M1 Pro MacBook for coding + Windows RTX 3090 for training
- **Cost Analysis**: $2,700 total vs. $10,850 cloud (76% savings, 1,444% ROI)
- **Framework**: RecBole + PyTorch with Sequential Recommendation focus
- **Timeline**: 2-3 months with superior development experience
- **Technical Documentation**:
  - `docs/architecture/recommendation-systems-analysis.md` - Complete multi-agent evaluation
  - `docs/architecture/local-gpu-training-setup.md` - RTX 3090 training environment guide

### Cross-Platform Development Workflow
**M1 MacBook (Primary Development)**:
- Code development in VS Code / Claude
- API integration with Next.js backend
- Data pipeline development and testing
- Git version control and collaboration

**Windows RTX 3090 (ML Training)**:
- RecBole model training and optimization
- Hyperparameter tuning with 24GB VRAM
- Model export to ONNX format
- Remote access via SSH/RDP from MacBook
