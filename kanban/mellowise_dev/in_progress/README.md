# In Progress - Stories Currently Being Worked On

Stories currently under active development.

## Current Status

**MELLOWISE-011 - Content Recommendation Engine** (8 pts) - ✅ **IN_PROGRESS**
- **Status**: Active development with full agent team coordination
- **Dependencies**: ✅ All met (Epic 2 Phases 1-2 complete)
- **Team Consensus**: Implement AI intelligence engine first, then goal tracking

## Workflow

When starting work on a card:

1. Move the card from `backlog/` to `in_progress/`
2. **CRITICAL**: Copy **Agent Team** and **Lead Responsibilities** sections from backlog README.md
3. Update the card's JSON status to "in_progress"
4. Add started_date timestamp
5. Use TodoWrite tool to track implementation progress
6. Coordinate with assigned agents using `*agent [agent-name]` commands
7. Follow the lead responsibilities for comprehensive coverage
8. Update the card regularly during development

## Agent Team Assignments

### **MELLOWISE-011: Content Recommendation Engine** (8 pts) - ✅ **ACTIVE**

**Agent Team**: 🏗️ Architect + 💻 Dev + 📊 Analyst + 🧪 QA + 📝 PO

**Lead Responsibilities**:
- 🏗️ **Architect (Winston)**: Design recommendation algorithm architecture, API design for ML integration, database schema for content scoring
- 💻 **Dev (James)**: Implement recommendation algorithms, integrate with existing learning style/difficulty systems
- 📊 **Analyst (Mary)**: Research content recommendation patterns, competitive analysis of learning platforms
- 🧪 **QA (Quinn)**: Test recommendation accuracy, performance testing for algorithm execution
- 📝 **PO (Sarah)**: Define acceptance criteria for recommendation quality, prioritize content types

**Implementation Strategy**: Leverage Context7 for latest ML recommendation patterns, build on existing Epic 2 Phase 1-2 infrastructure

## Guidelines

- Only one developer should work on a card at a time
- Keep cards in this directory actively updated with progress
- Move to `review/` when implementation is complete
- Coordinate with team members to avoid conflicts
