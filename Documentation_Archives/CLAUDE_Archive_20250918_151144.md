# Mellowise Development Context & Status

## üö® AUTOMATED WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT üö®
**BEFORE ANY CARD IMPLEMENTATION:**
1. `./kanban/workflow-check.sh CARD-ID` - **NOW INCLUDES AUTOMATIC AGENT TEAM VALIDATION**
2. Follow status instructions (move to in_progress if needed)
3. **COPY AGENT TEAM ASSIGNMENTS** from source to destination README.md
4. Create todos for status tracking
5. Only code when card is IN_PROGRESS

### ü§ñ **Multi-Layer Enforcement System**

#### **Layer 1: Automated Scripts**
- **`./kanban/agent-team-validator.sh`**: Validates agent team info is properly copied between statuses
- **Enhanced `./kanban/workflow-check.sh`**: Now automatically runs agent team validation
- **Blocking Errors**: Scripts prevent progression until agent team info is copied

#### **Layer 2: BMad Agent Self-Enforcement**
- **All BMad agents now display workflow reminders on activation**
- **Dev Agent**: "üíª ALWAYS run ./kanban/workflow-check.sh CARD-ID before coding"
- **Architect Agent**: "üèóÔ∏è System design decisions must reference agent team assignments"
- **UX Expert**: "üé® UI/UX decisions must align with agent team plan"
- **QA Agent**: "üß™ Testing strategy must follow agent team assignments"
- **Orchestrator**: "üé≠ Ensure agent team assignments are copied to current status"

#### **Layer 3: Workflow Validation**
- **Status Transitions**: MUST copy **Agent Team** + **Lead Responsibilities** sections
- **Perfect Accountability**: Agent team records follow cards through entire lifecycle
- **Historical Tracking**: Done directory maintains permanent agent contribution records

#### **Layer 4: Automatic Compliance Checking**
```bash
# Validates agent team workflow compliance
./kanban/agent-team-validator.sh MELLOWISE-011 backlog in_progress

# Enhanced workflow check with agent validation
./kanban/workflow-check.sh MELLOWISE-011
```

**‚úÖ RESULT: Zero chance of losing agent team coordination during card transitions**

## Standard Development Workflow (MANDATORY)

### üö® **Before Starting ANY Card Implementation**

**STEP 1: Validate Workflow Status**
```bash
./kanban/workflow-check.sh CARD-ID
```

**STEP 2: Follow Workflow Status Instructions**
- If in **BACKLOG**: Move to in_progress.md before coding
- If in **IN_PROGRESS**: Ready to code, update progress regularly  
- If in **REVIEW**: Implementation complete, focus on testing
- If in **DONE**: No work needed

**STEP 3: Create Todos for Status Tracking**
```
1. "Move CARD-ID from [current] to [next] status"
2. "Update CARD-ID progress during implementation"
3. "Move CARD-ID to review when complete"
```

**STEP 4: Begin Implementation**
Only after card is properly in IN_PROGRESS status.

### ‚ùå **NEVER START CODING WITHOUT:**
1. Running workflow-check.sh first
2. Card being in IN_PROGRESS status
3. Proper todos set up for tracking

## Quick Start Commands for Next Session

```bash
# 1. Activate BMad System
/BMad:agents:bmad-orchestrator

# 2. Check current status  
*status

# 3. Validate next card workflow
./kanban/workflow-check.sh CARD-ID

# 4. Continue architectural work
*agent architect

# 5. Begin database implementation 
*agent dev

# 6. Key files for reference:
# - /kanban/mellowise_dev/ (project cards)
# - /supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql (current schema)
# - /docs/architecture/ (technical specifications)
```

## üîÑ Kanban Workflow Safeguards

### **Mandatory Workflow Validation**
Before starting any card implementation, always run:
```bash
./kanban/workflow-check.sh CARD-ID
```

### **Required Workflow Steps**
1. **NEVER skip in_progress status** - All cards must follow: `backlog ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí review ‚Üí done`
2. **Always validate card location** before starting work
3. **Update progress regularly** during implementation
4. **Use todos to track status transitions**

### **Workflow Files**
- `kanban/workflow-checklist.md` - Detailed workflow guidelines
- `kanban/workflow-check.sh` - Quick card status validation script
- `kanban/validate-workflow.sh` - Comprehensive workflow validation (advanced)

**Architectural Insight**: Building proper multi-tenant, multi-exam foundation now prevents massive technical debt later. This is the difference between a demo and a scalable product. üèóÔ∏è
