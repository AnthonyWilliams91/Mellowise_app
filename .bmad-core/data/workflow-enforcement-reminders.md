## Auto-Trigger Conditions

These reminders are automatically displayed when:

1. **Agent Activation**: Every agent shows relevant reminder on startup
2. **Card Status Check**: Triggered by ./kanban/workflow-check.sh
3. **BMad Orchestrator**: Reminds user of agent workflow when switching agents
4. **Pre-Implementation**: Before any development task begins

## Enforcement Escalation

If workflow violations are detected:

1. **Warning**: Display violation message with fix instructions
2. **Blocking**: Prevent progression until agent team info is properly copied
3. **Guidance**: Show exact steps to resolve workflow violation
4. **Validation**: Re-run checks until compliance achieved

## Success Metrics

Track workflow compliance with:
- Agent team info propagation rate: 100%
- Workflow validation completion: 100%
- Agent coordination success: Measured by deliverable quality
- Zero cards moved without agent team info copying
