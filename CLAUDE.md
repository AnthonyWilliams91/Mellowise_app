#### **Date Stamping Requirements**
**MANDATORY**: Before making ANY additions to .md files:
1. **Check Today's Date**: Always verify the current date from system environment
2. **Date Stamp Placement**: Add timestamp on the line ABOVE any new content being added
3. **Format**: Use format `**Updated**: [Current Date] at [Current Time] [Timezone]`
4. **Examples**:
   ```markdown
   **Updated**: January 20, 2025 at 3:45 PM EST
   ## New Section Being Added
   ```

**Critical**: Never assume or guess dates - always check the actual current date before adding timestamps.

## 🎭 **BMad Orchestrator Integration**

### **Agent Coordination Protocol**

**Activation**: Use `/BMad:agents:bmad-orchestrator` for multi-agent coordination

#### **BMad Orchestrator Commands** (All commands require \* prefix)

- **`*help`**: Display available commands and specialist agents
- **`*agent [name]`**: Transform into specialized agent (AI Specialist, Dev Agent, UX Expert, etc.)
- **`*workflow [name]`**: Start specific workflows for card implementation
- **`*status`**: Show current context and active agent state
- **`*plan`**: Create detailed workflow plans before implementation

#### **Agent Selection Guidelines**

- **AI/ML Cards**: AI Specialist + Data Scientist
- **Backend/API Cards**: Dev Agent + Architect Agent
- **Frontend/UI Cards**: UX Expert + Dev Agent
- **Analytics Cards**: QA Agent + AI Specialist
- **Infrastructure Cards**: Architect Agent + Dev Agent

#### **Orchestrator Usage Patterns**

1. **Pre-Implementation**: Use `*agent` to select appropriate specialists
2. **Complex Cards**: Use `*workflow` for structured multi-step processes
3. **Context Reviews**: Use `*status` to understand current project state
4. **Agent Handoffs**: Document agent transitions in dev logs and kanban READMEs

**Critical Integration**: The BMad Orchestrator works with claude_dev_log system and kanban workflow to provide comprehensive development coordination.

---

## 🚨 **Automated Workflow Enforcement**

### **Pre-Implementation Protocol (MANDATORY)**

Before starting ANY card implementation:

1. **Context Review & BMad Agent Coordination**:

   ```bash
   # Review development history for context and dependencies
   # Check /claude_dev_log/mvp_initial/ for similar card patterns

   # Activate BMad Orchestrator for team coordination
   /BMad:agents:bmad-orchestrator
   *agent [specialist-type]  # Based on card requirements
   ```

2. **Workflow Validation & Context Preparation**:

   ```bash
   ./kanban/workflow-check.sh CARD-ID
   ```

3. **Agent Team Assignment & Context Documentation**:
   - Copy **Agent Team** + **Lead Responsibilities** sections from source to destination README.md
   - Reference relevant dev logs for agent coordination patterns
   - Validate agent team info is properly copied using:

   ```bash
   ./kanban/agent-team-validator.sh CARD-ID source_status target_status
   ```

4. **Status Transition & Development Logging Requirements**:
   - Cards MUST follow: `backlog → in_progress → review → done`
   - Agent team assignments must be copied during ALL status transitions
   - Create todos for status tracking before beginning implementation
   - Update relevant dev logs with implementation progress and agent contributions

### **BMad Agent Coordination Requirements**

**CRITICAL**: Before beginning any new card, use the BMad Orchestrator (`@.bmad-core/agents/bmad-orchestrator.md`) to:

- **Review Past Work**: Call on relevant specialist agents to assess completed implementations
- **Identify Issues**: Have agents review dependencies and integration points
- **Determine Execution Order**: Get agent recommendations for remaining Epic 2 cards
- **Resource Assessment**: Validate what might need to be added or removed for consideration

**Required Agent Consultation Process**:

1. Activate BMad Orchestrator: `/BMad:agents:bmad-orchestrator`
2. Call relevant specialists based on card type:
   - **AI/ML Cards**: AI Specialist + Data Scientist
   - **Backend/API**: Dev Agent + Architect Agent
   - **Frontend/UI**: UX Expert + Dev Agent
   - **Analytics**: QA Agent + AI Specialist
3. Have agents assess current state and provide implementation guidance
4. Document agent recommendations in card's **Agent Team** section

### **Enforcement Layers**

- **Layer 1**: Automated scripts block progression without proper workflow compliance
- **Layer 2**: BMad agents display workflow reminders on activation
- **Layer 3**: Status transitions require copying agent team assignments
- **Layer 4**: Automatic compliance checking via validation scripts

---

## 🔧 **Development Standards**

### **Workflow Validation Commands**

```bash
# Quick card status check
./kanban/workflow-check.sh CARD-ID

# Agent team validation
./kanban/agent-team-validator.sh CARD-ID source_status target_status

# Comprehensive workflow validation
./kanban/validate-workflow.sh
```

### **Required Steps for Any Card**

1. ✅ Review development history in `/claude_dev_log/mvp_initial/` for context and patterns
2. ✅ Run workflow-check.sh CARD-ID
3. ✅ Activate BMad Orchestrator for agent coordination (`/BMad:agents:bmad-orchestrator`)
4. ✅ Move card to in_progress status if needed
5. ✅ Copy agent team assignments to current status README.md
6. ✅ Create todos for progress tracking
7. ✅ Begin implementation only after card is IN_PROGRESS
8. ✅ Update dev logs with agent contributions and technical achievements

### **Context Preservation Best Practices**

#### **Session Handoffs**

- **Pre-Session**: Review latest dev logs and kanban status for current context
- **During Sessions**: Document agent decisions and technical rationale
- **Post-Session**: Update dev logs with implementation details and next steps
- **Agent Transitions**: Include agent handoff notes in kanban README.md files

#### **Development Continuity**

- **Epic Patterns**: Reference similar cards within the same epic for consistency
- **Agent Expertise**: Leverage documented agent specializations from previous cards
- **Technical Decisions**: Maintain architectural consistency using dev log documentation
- **Dependency Tracking**: Use dev logs to understand card interdependencies

#### **Context Documentation Standards**

- **Implementation Details**: Document key technical decisions and code patterns
- **Agent Attribution**: Track which agents contributed to specific features
- **Achievement Tracking**: Record story points, lines of code, and feature completions
- **Integration Points**: Note how cards integrate with existing platform components
- **Date Stamp Protocol**: Always check current date and add timestamp ABOVE any new .md content

**Usage**: These practices ensure seamless development across sessions and prevent context loss during agent handoffs.
